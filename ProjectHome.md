The objective of the system is to provide data on the location of each responsible and stimulating inter-relationship of them. Responsible Each has access to a database in which there are other leaders and their locations. When a need to leave the house and can not get someone to accompany the elderly, it can look for another that is responsible for close on days in which he is absent. Thus, through the system, the Seniors always have the opportunity to be accompanied by a responsible person while that originally accompanied the missing.
